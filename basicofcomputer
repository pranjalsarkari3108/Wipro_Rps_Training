## fundamentals of computer:-

It is a electronic device.
It storing, processing the information.
which is used to do some calculation. and many more things and
moder computer and do.

----> scanario, right now we are doing online session,
how it getting possible..?
(electronic device) --> laptop,desktop, table, mobile,
internet.---> connecting the device over network.

      computer has hardware and software.

      hardware:-
      ----------
           physical device
           (here we can touch and feel)

      software:-
      ----------
          logical
          (imaginary)
             --> system sofware (operation system)
                    operating system:- manages the hardware.
                                       manages the storages
                                       manages the power...etc

             --> application software
                     msword
                     vscode

============================================================================
types of application.

---

1.desktop application --> chrome,vscode, excel, 2. web application 3. mobile application

## desktop application:-

    drawbacks:-
    ------------

->It is a installable software.
-> It is take the storage from the device,
-> we cannot access the application remotely
-> we have to take care about maintanance.

## web application:-

    ->remotely from any device we can access.
    ->we need internet to access (we are in era of internet,we will get internet easily).

       2 types of web application.
       ----------------------------
       1. static web application.  (about us page)

             technology used:-
             --------------------
             html, css,

             the content is same to all the user

       2. dynamic web application.
             the content will be based on user login

             mybookings:-
             -------------
               (the based on the user login the content is changed)

             facebook, instagram,  --> profile page will show, based on user login,

              technology used:-
              -----------------
              frontend-> reactjs       // user interface, presentation logic
              backend -> python, java, c#, php, // business logic
                                                if(balance>transferAmount)
                                                    successfull
                                                else
                                                   failed


              database -> mysql,mongodb, oracle, //to store data permenantly, we use database.

Evolution of programming language.

language:-

---

    communication

## programming language:-

communication with the computer. (hardware.)
n number of programming languages,

computer knows binary language. 0's and 1's.

## evolution of programming languages:-

1.machine level language.
2.assembly level language.
3.high level language.
4.oops
5.data scienece/ machine learning/ AI.

1.machine level language:-

---

    0's and 1's

    8    +    6    = > 14
    1010 100 1011   => 10101

## 2.Assembly level language:-

        8    +    6     => 14
       1010  ADD  1011  => 1010

phenomics has introduced, like add,sub, mul,div

    assembler will convert the assembly level language to binary level language.

## 3.High level language:-

     c,cobol,fortan

         It is easily understand by computer and human being.
            if(loginTime>9)
                 absent
            else
               present

    C has both high level and low level feature, so later it is termed as
    middle level language.
       high level feature: condition stmt, looping stmt,...
       low level feature: pointer

## 4.oops:-

    why we develope software..?
      to solve our day to day life problem.

    20 years back:-
    ----------------
       if we want to buy something for the breakfast...?
          go the restraunt
          choose the menu
          place the order
          pay for the order
          collect the order

    why we need oops..?
      -> to solve real world problems.
      -> by using oops, we can design the software based on real world
        objects.

          It is based on class and objects.

      class Restraunt
      {

      }
      class Order
      {

      }

## 5.machine learning/AI:-

## home architecture:-

    hall,kitchen,dining area,...

## office architecture:-

    cabin, cafe, parking,metting rooms, servcer,....

web application architecture:-

---

fronted
backend
database

## computer architecture:-

     hardware compoents which will execute programs

components,
CPU
Memory
Input and Output
Instruction Set Architecture
System Interconnects

CPU:-

---

    ->It is the heart of the computer

Control Unit:-

---

    for the given input, what should be the output.

ALU:-

---

     arithmetic and logical unit

     arithmetic operation:-
     ----------------------
       2+2 =4

      logical operation:-
      -------------------
       4>3=> true

memory:-

---

    storing the data

=================================================================  
a=10 // instruction 1
b=20 // instruction 2
result = a+b // instrcution 3
result = result\*2 // instruction 4

execution of instruction in cpu.
1.fetch
2.decode
3.execute
4.write

     1. fetch:-
     ------------
        It can fetch the next instruction from the memroy

     2. Decode:-
     -------------
          decode the instruction , which operands needs to perform
            aritchmetic
            logic

     3. Execute:-
         perform the operations

     4. write:-
          write the back the result to the memory

=======================================================================
laptop:-

---

processor:-
i5, rayzon,i7, dual core,....

    inside the processor only, cpu will execute the instruction.

========================================================================

a device can have one or more processor, based on the configuration.

## parallel processing:-

In processing, the it divides the task into number of subtask
and each sub task has certain instruction.

     eg:-
     ----
        gaming laptop.
        --------------
        multiple cpus,
         cpu 1  --> to capturation high graphics gpu
         cpu 2  --> game control
         .
         .
         cpu 3  --->


    Parallel processing is a method in computing of running two or more processors (CPUs) to handle separate parts of an overall task. Breaking up different parts of a task among multiple processors will help reduce the amount of time to run a program.
